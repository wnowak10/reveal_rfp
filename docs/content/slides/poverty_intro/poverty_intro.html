	            While poverty in America declined in the 1960s, lately it has stagnated
		    around 13%. But this average masks significant variation, for example across
		    racial and geographic lines. 27% of Black Americans live in poverty.
	            The poverty rate varies dramatically across different regions of the country, as well.

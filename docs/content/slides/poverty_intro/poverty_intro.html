	            After some progress in the 1960's, the overall poverty rate in America has stagnated around its present value (13%). Worse, still, is that this average masks a wide array of realities for different Americans. For example, this 13% grows to 27% for all black Americans. Similar geographic variation can be see upon further investigation.
